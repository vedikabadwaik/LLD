2.Admin
-we can there will be a seperate profile of an admin
-can add the new shows in the respective theatre, timings of it.
-let's say there are multiple booking platforms from where a person can book but we have the same theatre. So admin should allocate number of seats to respective booking
platform. So that user using particular platform can see only those seats available to book which is alloted to their platform
-can update and delete the show/theatre details

3.System
-should maintain logs
-should send notification it can be SMS, whatsapp or email to the user informing about successful payment, reminder of thier show etc.

 If the person is unable to book within that time, allow others to see that seat available.
